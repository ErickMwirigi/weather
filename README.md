## Button Component
The Button component handles user login and signup actions. It manages the user's login state and displays a welcome message when logged in.

## DailyData Component
The DailyData component displays the weather data for a selected date. It allows users to switch between two views, 'anga' and 'mkulima,' which show different weather details.

## Data Component
The Data component is a reusable table row for displaying weather data. It receives data as props and renders it in a table row.

## Description Component
The Description component provides a weather analysis description based on the selected view ('anga' or 'mkulima'). It displays different information depending on the user's choice.

## Header Component
The Header component contains the application's header, including navigation links, the current time, and a date picker for selecting a specific date and time.
